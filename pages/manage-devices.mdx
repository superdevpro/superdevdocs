# Manage Devices

Each SuperDev Pro license allows you to activate it on three or more devices, browsers, or browser profiles, depending on your license type. If you've reached your device limit, our [device management](https://superdevpro.com/devices) page is here to help.

## How It Works

The device management page helps you to remove devices based on:

- **Operating System**: Select your device based on the OS.
- **Browser Name**: Select your device based on the browser name.
- **Browser Version**: Select your device based on the browser version.
- **Activation Date**: Select your device based on the activation date.
