# Image Replacer

Image Replacer feature enables you to quickly replace `<img>`, `<picture>` or `<svg>` images on any website with local image files, allowing quick visualization of alternative visual assets without modifying the source code. You can easily undo changes using `Ctrl+Z` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd+Z` on macOS. All modifications persist until the page is refreshed, making it ideal for testing different visual assets in live environments.
