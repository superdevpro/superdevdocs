# Delete Element

Delete Element feature allows you to quickly remove or hide webpage elements. It uses CSS `display: none` for deletion and `visibility: hidden` for hiding, based on user settings. You can easily undo changes using `Ctrl+Z` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd+Z` on macOS. All modifications persist until the page is refreshed, making it ideal for troubleshooting, client presentations, and design iterations.
