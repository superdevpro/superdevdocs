# Color Picker

Color Picker feature allows you to pick colors from any element on a website, down to the pixel level, even from images, videos, moving elements, and everything else, in `Hex`, `RGB`, or `HSL` color format. Furthermore, you also have the option to copy individual colors or create an entire color palette. These color values can be copied to your clipboard or exported for future use.
