# Fonts Changer

Fonts Changer feature allows you to experiment with 1000+ Google fonts across six categories: sans-serif, serif, monospace, display, local, and handwriting. Apply fonts to the entire website, headings, paragraphs, or specific HTML tags. Changes can be saved to extension storage, copied to clipboard, or exported for use in other projects. This enables quick font testing and comparison directly in the browser.
