# Live Text Editor

Live Text Editor feature allows you to modify text on any website in real-time, providing instant visual feedback without altering the source code. You can easily undo changes using `Ctrl+Z` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd+Z` on macOS. All modifications persist until the page is refreshed, making it ideal for temporary edits and rapid iterations.
